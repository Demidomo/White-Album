        <li><em>Colours of the Rainbow</em>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an array containing the seven colours of the rainbow.</li>
                <li>Ask the user using a prompt what their favourite colour is.</li>
                <li>Check to see if their favourite colour is in the array (casing of letters should not be relevant
                    e.g. "Red" should equate to "red".</li>
                <li>If their favourite colour happens to be one of the colours in the rainbow array, remove this colour
                    from the array. In a single console.log print out the remaining colours separated by " *** " in
                    reverse alphabetical order (Z -> A).</li>
                <li>If their favourite colour is not in the array then print out the entire array in a single

        <li><em>99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall</em>
            <br>
            Starting from 99 and working your way down to 0, print a separate console.log for each number.
            <ul>
                <li>If the number is divisible by 6, print "smash" instead of the number.</li>
                <li>If the number is divisible by 4, print "bang" instead of the number.</li>
                <li>If the number is divisible by both 6 and 4, print "wallop".</li>
            </ul>
            The first ten console.logs should look like<br>
            99 98 97 Wallop 95 94 93 Bang 91 Smash.
            <p>You may want to look up the <em>modulous operator</em> % in JavaScript to help you figure out the
                divisible part of the code. Saying a number is divisible by 6 means that if I divide that number by 6 I
                should be left with 0 remainder. Such numbers include 6, 12, 18, 24 etc.</p>

                <li>There are X number of students in the array.</li>
                <li>The longest name in the array is X.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>...</li>
                <li>You can assume that there is only 1 longest name i.e. no joint longest names. Also hyphens - count
                    as characters.</li>
                <li>You should count for both lowercase "m" and uppercase "M".</li>
                <li>You need to store the names that begin with "J" in a new array and then use this array to output the
                    message. Check for both lowercase "j" and uppercase "J" in the first letter position.</li>
